# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which I built back in **2020** to learn **React** and expand my web development skills. At the time, I was exploring modern front-end development and experimenting with tools and techniques to create engaging user experiences. While this project marked an important milestone in my growth as a developer, it now stands as a snapshot of how much I’ve learned since.

## About the Website

The website was designed to showcase my work, share my thoughts, and serve as a sandbox for learning new technologies. Built with **React** and styled using **Bootstrap**, it reflects the design and development practices I was exploring at the time.

### Key Features:

- Static content powered by React
- Styled using **Bootstrap**, which was still widely regarded as the go-to CSS framework for rapid development
- Basic responsiveness to accommodate various screen sizes
- Interactive animations using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**, as I was eager to learn how animations could elevate user experiences

## Growth and Current Perspective

Since building this site, I’ve grown into a senior engineer and gained significant experience in modern web development. Looking back, there are many aspects I would approach differently now:

- **Styling:**  
  While **Bootstrap** was a great tool in 2020, today I would use **Tailwind CSS** for its utility-first approach, which enables rapid development and consistent design systems. Tailwind's flexibility and maintainability align better with my current workflow.

- **React Practices:**

  - Migrate class components to functional components.
  - Replace the then-new React lifecycle methods with **React hooks** for cleaner, more efficient state management.
  - Embrace modern optimizations like **code-splitting**, **lazy loading**, and **error boundaries**.

- **Animations:**  
  While GSAP was a fantastic library to learn animations, I would now pair it with modern CSS transitions or explore libraries like **Framer Motion** for React, which integrates seamlessly with component-based architecture.

- **Tooling and Workflow:**  
  If revisiting this project today, I would utilize **Vite** for its fast bundling and **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**. Vite's modern toolchain drastically improves development speed and efficiency compared to traditional setups like Create React App.

## Why I Haven’t Rewritten It Yet

As much as I’d love to modernize this project, I haven’t found the time to rewrite it using the latest conventions. Between building and scaling production-grade applications, and enjoying life away from the computer, this project remains a reminder of my learning journey.

That said, if I were to revisit this project, I would:

- Rewrite the codebase to adopt **modern React practices**.
- Introduce **Tailwind CSS** to replace Bootstrap for more efficient styling.
- Integrate **Framer Motion** or advanced GSAP animations to further refine the user experience.
- Use **Vite** for its fast development experience and Hot Module Replacement.

## Closing Thoughts

This project reflects where I started and how much I’ve grown. While it may no longer represent my current expertise, it’s a reminder of the iterative nature of software development—and the passion that drives it.
